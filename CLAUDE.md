# AI-DLC and Spec-Driven Development

Kiro-style Spec Driven Development implementation on AI-DLC (AI Development Life Cycle)

## Project Context

### Paths
- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`
- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`
- Lessons: `.claude/tasks/lessons.md`

### Steering vs Specification

**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context
**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features

### Active Specifications
- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications
- Use `/kiro:spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress

## Development Guidelines
- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).

## Minimal Workflow
- Phase 0 (optional): `/kiro:steering`, `/kiro:steering-custom`
- Phase 1 (Specification):
  - `/kiro:spec-init "description"`
  - `/kiro:spec-requirements {feature}`
  - `/kiro:validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)
  - `/kiro:spec-design {feature} [-y]`
  - `/kiro:validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)
  - `/kiro:spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`
- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/kiro:spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`
  - `/kiro:validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)
- Progress check: `/kiro:spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)

## Development Rules
- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track
- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/kiro:spec-status`
- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.

## Workflow

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- This applies within each phase of the spec workflow – plan before executing, not just before specifying
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately – don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `.claude/tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- When `/kiro:validate-impl` is available, use it as the primary verification method
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes – don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests – then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Core Principles

- Simplicity First: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- No Laziness: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- Minimal Impact: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
- Use AskUserQuetionTool: When you need to confirm something with the user, use the AskUserQuestionTool to clear each one individually.

## Steering Configuration
- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory
- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
- Custom files are supported (managed via `/kiro:steering-custom`)
